# Stress Level Classification using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the use of **Logistic Regression** to classify participants' stress levels based on their **PSS (Perceived Stress Scale)** scores. The model predicts whether a participant is experiencing high or low stress.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset, `stresveri.csv`, contains information about participants' stress scores (`PSS_score`) and other relevant features. A binary column, `high_stress`, is created based on whether the `PSS_score` is above the median value.

## Steps

1. **Load & Explore Data**: The dataset is loaded and basic exploration is performed to understand its structure.
2. **Feature Engineering**: A new column `high_stress` is created, where participants are classified as having high or low stress based on the median of their PSS scores.
3. **Visualization**: The distribution of stress levels is plotted, and a confusion matrix is visualized as a heatmap.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: A **Logistic Regression** model is trained using the dataset, followed by evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. **ROC Curve**: An ROC curve is plotted, and the AUC (Area Under the Curve) is calculated to assess model performance.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the use of **Logistic Regression** for binary classification of stress levels. It evaluates the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and the ROC curve. The code can be extended to experiment with other classification models and feature engineering techniques.
